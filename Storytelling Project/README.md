# Sales and Returns Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of sales and returns data from January 2018 to December 2021. The analysis was performed using a Tableau dashboard, focusing on uncovering insights to optimize sales performance, reduce return rates, and enhance customer behavior understanding. Key metrics such as sales volume, return rates, and customer segmentation are visualized to aid in business strategy decisions.

The primary purpose of this project was twofold. First, I used the dataset to build the dashboard in order to develop my skills and learn Tableau. Second, it was to use the Tableau storyboard feature to put a presentation together that could be presented to stakeholders.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Explore, Filter and Join Data**: Understand the dataset, identify and clean relevant data.
- **Study The Data**: Build several different worksheets looking at different measures to determine the cause of and reduce the return rates.
- **Build a Dashboard**: I first created several mockups for a dashboard layout, then chose visualizations that were relevant and fit the dashboard.
- **Glean Insights and Tell a Story**: After putting everything together, it was time to present. 

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Visualization with Tableau**: Used Tableau to take raw data and put it into meaningful visualizations to help solve a business problem. 
- **Data Interpretation**: Interpreted the visualizations to glean meaninful insights. 
- **Insight Application**: Used the insights to present potential solutions to the business problem.
- **Presentation**: Used the story board functionality to build and present a story.

## Conclusion
This project provided a great opportunity to learn one of the most commonly used applications in a Business Intelligence analyst role. While I may be used to impromptu communication and relaying findings, this was a great opportunity to really sit down and determine what information is truly pertinent and what is not.
