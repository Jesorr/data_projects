# KPI Power BI Report

## Overview
This Power BI report presents key profitability metrics for the years 2022-2024, focusing on year-to-date (YTD) performance compared to the previous year-to-date (PYTD). The report helps identify trends in performance, gross profit, and account profitability across various countries and product segments. The primary purpose on my end was to hone my skills with PowerBI and work on learning to use switches to increase the usability of my reports.

## Key Metrics:
- The primary metrics used - shown as switches - are Sales, Quantity, and Gross Profit.
- Each metric has a YTD, a PYTD, and a YTD vs PYTD measure.
- I also used the Gross Profit and Sales values to calculate GP% to show overall profitability based on different factors.

## Visualizations:
1. **Bottom 10 Countries by YTD vs PYTD Values**:
   - This visualization shows the 10 countries with the most significant decline in a dynamic value compared to the previous year.

2. **YTD vs PYTD by Month and Product Type**:
   - A waterfall chart that shows monthly trends for each metric broken down by country and product type.
  
3. **YTD & PYTD by Month**:
   - This column chart shows the comparison of different metrics between the current and previous years. The data is incomplete for 2024, and there is not PYTD data for 2022, so it only works properly when looking at data from 2023.

4. **Account Profitability Segmentation**:
   - This section segments accounts by GP% and a dynamic metric to highlight performance across various segments. It helps identify which accounts are most profitable and how they contribute to overall performance.

## Usage:
This report can be used to monitor:
- Trends in overall profitability and performance.
- Dynamic KPI fluctuations over time and across regions.
- Opportunities for improvement in underperforming regions.
- Key account profitability and growth areas for the 2024 fiscal year.

## Tools Used:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Data Source**: Sales and profit data for 2024 YTD compared with the previous year.
